# E05 Part-1

Everythin react can do , you can do using HTML/CSS/JS , Then why react ?


major job of a library like react is that it makes developers life easy and application more smooth 

# Lets get hooked 


React Hooks

Before getting started we will 1st clean up our code 

Earlier we wrote everything in a single file (App.js) , its not a good practice 
Best practice is to make seperate files for seperate component 


Folder structure
All the main react code is kept in src folder.


move App.js to src folder 
in index.html file change the location of the file (<script type="module" src="./src/App.js">)

seperate files for seperate components 

Big applications might have 1000s of components , so if structuring of files is not done in proper way , then it will impact the readiblity of the code .
(remember , we are writing code for other humans too )

src folder --> component folder --> components 

always keep the components file name same as the component name , even the casing (ex: Header.js  --> for header component)
you can also write filename as Header.jsx  or Header.tsx(typescript) ==> (but it hardly matters)

 
google --> react.org --> file/folder structure --> React doesnt recommend any particular structure , but suggests some common practices .



In our App.js we are using header compenent , hence we need to import Header in App.js , but before importing we need to export Header.js using

in Header.js file--> copy paste Header component code 
export default Header; 


in App.js (import)
import Header from "./components/Header";


similarly do the same for body component

similarly for ResturantCard component 

But since the resturant card is being rendered in the body component , so in the body component we need to do :  import ResturantCard from "./ResturantCard";

ResturantCard depends on our ResList data(dummy data from swiggy ) , which is in App.js file , so we can :-
1) copy paste the data in ResturantCard.js file --> the app will work fine 
But its not a recommended way ,  component folder should never contain anyt hard coded data . (industry practice )

Hence ResList should not be kept over here 
Apart from ResList , our logo and image in the cards are also hard coded . They must also be not kept in components folder .

So , where should we keep them ?

They shoul be kept in constants file (constants.js / utils.js /cofigs.js/ common.js  ) ( any name)

we will create utils folder --> constants.js 

in constants.js file , currently we are keeping  our logo url(Header component ) and card image url(ResturantCard)

//constants.js 
export const CDN_URL="https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/";

export const LOGO_URL="https://images-platform.99static.com/PqkxPzdIGHYlwJzMzFSLbWCaI0g=/0x0:1181x1181/500x500/top/smart/99designs-contests-attachments/134/134197/attachment_134197839";


im mockData.js file we will keep our ResList data(dummy data from swiggy )

The ResList needs to be used by Body component , hence in body component
import resList from "../../utils/mockData";


constansts.js file data must be exported to respective components (LOGO_URL (Header component ) and CDN_URL(ResturantCard))

There are 2 types of export and import 
1) default export
export defauls <Component name>
import ComponentName from "patht"

named export
if there are muktiple variables which needs to be exported , in that case 
export default cannot be written twice 
So , if we want to export multiple items from the same file :-

2) we can use named export  

write export infront of the variable :-

export const CDN_URL;
export const LOGO_UR;


-->importing named exports (CDN_URL;) (in ResturantCard) -----> we need to use {}

import { CDN_URL }  from "../../utils/constants";

-->importing  named export (LOGO_URL) (in Header)

import { LOGO_URL } from "../../utils/constants";
-->using LOGO_URL 
  src={LOGO_URL} ---> since its JSX and LOGO_URL is a js variable . Hence we need to wrap it up in {}.



(Q) HW--> can we do default export and named export together ?






# E05 part-2

#  React Hooks 

make our website dynamic/interactive by adding some features

lets create a button on clicking which it shows only top rated resturants (rating >4 stars)


<div className="filter">
        <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{console.log("clicked")}}>Top Rated Restaurants</button>
        
        </div>

currently on clicking our button it prints "clicked" on cosole
 we need to filter out  only top rated resturants by clicking the button

 we need to write some filter logic



----

Currently we are getting resturnat data from resList . 

suppose we modify the resList and chnage it to  listOfRestaurants which contains details of 2 resturants only 

const listOfRestaurants = [{
  info: {
    id: "1",
    name: "KFC",
    cuisines: ["Italian", "Pizza"],
    avgRating: 4.5,
    locality: "Downtown",
    cloudinaryImageId: "image2",
    sla: { deliveryTime: 30 }
  }
}, 
,{
  info: {
    id: "2",
    name: "Burger King",
    cuisines: ["American", "Burgers"],
    avgRating: 3.0,
    locality: "Uptown",
    cloudinaryImageId: "image2",
    sla: { deliveryTime: 25 }

  }

}

]


 {listOfRestaurants.map(restaurant => <ResturantCard key={restaurant.info.id} resData={restaurant}/>)}  
 
 --->
  this will output in only 2 resturants as it contains only 2 objects

  now we want to filter out the resturant  to get only top rated resturants by clicking the button(rating >4 stars)


we will use filter (revise --> map,filter,reduce)

  <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{
          listOfRestaurants=listOfRestaurants.filter(
            (res) =>res.info.avgRating > 4
          )
          console.log(listOfRestaurants);          ----> working fine   --> but ui is not being updated

        
it would be so cool , if our page would have automatically refreshed 
{listOfRestaurants.map(restaurant => <ResturantCard key={restaurant.info.id} resData={restaurant}/>)}   ----> this code is being rendered after the above code , but changes are not reflected here


This is the exact problem react is solving for us . 
This is the superpower react will provide us 
React is fast --> Its actually fast in DOM manipulation 

currently listOfRestaurants=[]  is  a normal js variable 

now i want to create a super powerful react variable ==> this variable is called state variable

How to create super powerful variables ?

---> react Hooks 
# React Hooks

what is functional component --> Normal JS function which returns JSX

what is react element   ---> plain JS object 


similarly ,

react hook --> is a normal JS utility function which is given to us by react(prebuilt function)(written by facebook developers) --> it has some superpowers


There are multiple hooks in react 
There are 2 most important React hooks (99% times used ) 

1) useState()
2) useEffect()


useState()--> To generate superpowerful State variables in react 

how to use React Hooks

you need to import it as named import 

import { useState } from "react";   (In whichever component you want to use it ) Ex: (in body.js )

why is it called state variable ?

as it maintains the state of the component

The scope of the local state variable is inside the  component 


creating state variable
const [listOfRestaurants]=useState();


normal variable
let listOfRestaurants;


------------------------------

creating state variable with empty array
const [listOfRestaurants]=useState([]);


normal variable
let listOfRestaurants =[];

-----------------------------------

giving data of 1 resturant 

const [listOfRestaurants]=useState([{
  data of resturant
}]);

-----------------------------------------

How to use the state variable 

--> you use it normally like  a normal variable 



How to modify a State variable ?

1st understand , how to modify a normal variable ?

let list="abc";
list="xyz;
console.log(list)

or 

const list =[];
list.push("item1")
console.log(list)




Modifying the State variable ;

we cannot modify directly 
we can do that by 
 by using a function which comes as a sencond arguement in the array 


const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState([
{
  .
  .
  .
}
])

its an industry practice to name the function (second arguement ) similar to the variable name by just using set infront of it .

setListOfResturant will be used to update the list 



whenever a state variable updates , React re-renders the component , it happen very quickly 


lets use the mockData
  const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState(resList);  ---> This is Array destructuring 
  
  rest everything will remain same 

  now when we click the button --> it will give us only (4 start + rated) resturants 


  This is the actual superpower of react --> it makes ui rendering very fast  


But How is react doing that BTS ?

react uses something known as reconciliation algorithm ---> also known as React Fiber
Ex: 
res-container --> contains 15 resturant cards (Now suppoese my UI changes from filtering 7 cards to only 3 filtered cards)

React creates a Virtual DOM 

  (Actual dom is <div>..inside <div>(with other tags ).<div>)

  Virtual DOM is a representation of actual DOM
  react virtual DOM is nothing but its a nested JS object


  Diff Algorithm finds out the difference between 2 virtual DOM 
React keeps track of all the html code 
old virtual DOM --> 15 resutrant card 

button clicked --> new object formed 

new virtual DOm --> 7 resturant cards 


Diff Algorithm finds out the difference between 2 virtual DOM(difference between 2 objects ) ---> In this case 15-7 =8 ==> then it will show 8 cards 


The whole algorithm above is known as React Fiber . ( This was updated in React16 )

React is fast because it maintains the  DOM manipulation very efficiently 


This is the reason react is most favoured library  in frontend

Read about react Fiber Architecture  (github acdlite )


React keeps an eye on state variable 

React will find out the diff ---> update the UI---> React will find out the diff ---> update the UI  (this cycle goes on and on )
