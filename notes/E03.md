# E03 --> Laying the foundation
======================================

# E03--Part1
--------
instead of writing npx parcel .\index.html everytiem lets write a script to automate it
in package.json 
 "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html",
    "test": "jest"
  },

* if you join a company and wnat to run/build the project locally , just go to pkg.json and  see what is there in scripts 

instead of writing npx parcel .\index.html  write 
npm run start
or
npm start

to build 
npm run build 


# E03--Part2

const heading=React.createElement("h1",{id: "heading"},"Namaste react from react element in react js");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
  


//React Element  --> similar to HTML element   . In the above code heading is an react element 
// React element are objects that represent a DOM node and its attributes or properties  . In the above code heading is an  object .
verify in browser console , it will show it as object

 root will remove/override/render the h1 tag in index.html with div id ="root"
 
 * in your main html file(index.html ) , keep <h1>Not rendered<h1>, so that if ever react is not rendered , you will h1 msg saying not rendered. 



# E03--Part3

creating h1 tag using react 

const heading=React.createElement("h1",{id: "heading"},"Namaste react from react element in react js");

its a very clumsy and confusing way of writing like this . creating h1 directly in index.html is relatively very easy 

so facebook developers created jsx (jsx is a javascript syntax which makes it easier to create react elements) 
* Note --> JSX is not a part of react

jsx makes developers life easy 

writing the same code using jsx

creating h1 tag using jsx 


const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste react from JSX in react js</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(jsxHeading);

jsx != HTML inside JS

jsx = HTML like syntax or XML like syntax

jsx is not javascript also . JS engine wont recogonize jsx syntax

console.log(heading); (from react code written above)
console.log(jsxHeading);(from jsx code)


both will return same output (object of same type)

(Q) The code you are writing is for human or machine ?
Ans --> for both , but 1st for humans or else we would have written it in Binary/ low level 

Hence from now on we will not be using react.createElement in our code again 

we will use JSX

JS engine won't understand jsx code as its not a pure JS code . 

when we write JSX code , it is transpiled (converted to browser understandable code ) before it reaches to JS engine .
Transpiling is done by Parcel (Babel (babel is present in node module ))  (babel = JS compiler or Transpiler )

JSX ==> React.createElement  ==> ReactElement(JS Object) ==> rendered as HTML Element . This is the reason we get the same output when we do 

 console.log(heading);
console.log(jsxHeading);

Babel is converting ,  JSX ==> React.createElement   (which is later converted into JS Object and then finaaly rendered as HTML element)

google --> babelJS.io (To see realtime conversions )



const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading" className="head">Namaste react from JSX in react js</h1>;
when we view the above code in console className will be converted to class (since JS understands class only (browser will only support HTML elements ))
while giving atributes to JSX , we have to use camelcase
HW --> explore various tags and attributes in jsx (image , href )



If your jsx is in single line its perfectly valid

but to write it in multiple lines , you have to wrap it in () ,its mandatory 

Ex:

const jsxHeading = (<h1 id="heading" className="head">
  Namaste react from JSX in react js
  </h1>

);



# E03--Part 4


# React Component
  --> Everything is a component in react


  2 ways of creating react component 

  1) class based component  --> old way (used earlier ) , it was a pain in A## to write class based component 
      Some legacy projects still uses class based components.

  2) Functional Component   --> new way   (99.99% used in industry)


React Functional Component 
--------------------------
its a normal JS function , which returns some JSX code
or 
A JavaScript function which returns react element 



const HeadingComponent = () => {
 return <h1>Namste React Functional Component</h1>
    
}
 or 

 const HeadingComponent2 = () =>( <h2>Namste React Functional Component 02</h2>)
     
for using multi lines 
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <h1 id="heading" className="head">
      Namaste react from JSX in react js
    </h1>
  );
    
}

to render react functonal component 


const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);         

  
Always use capital letters while naming a react component

Difference between element and a component ? Afterall we are achieving the same end result ?
--> The doubt will be resolved in later episodes 


  =================================================================
To render one functional component into another 
Component composition --> Component into component 

const Title =()=>(
  <h1 className="head">
    Namsste Title React Functional Component
  </h1>
)



const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title/>                -----> Title component inside heading component
    <h1 className="heading">Namste React Heading  Functional Component </h1>

  </div>
 
    
)

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<HeadingComponent />);
 
 output = Namsste Title React Functional Component
          Namste React Heading  Functional Component


interview Qs --> What is component composistion ?
The above code is called component composistion  
 Component inside component .

There are more ways to do this .
Instead of <Title/> , we can use 
 <Title></Title>
 {Title()}   
 
 all are same



# E03--Part 5

Instead of arrow fuction we can also use normal function using function keyword ? 
Yes 
But arrow function is more preffered way .



# writing JS inside JSX
* inside react functional component if we put {} , we can use any javascript program inside it 
Ex:


const num=100;
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title />
    <h1 className="heading">Namste React HeadingFunctional Component </h1>
    {
    num
    }

  </div>
 
    
)
In the output we will get the num also , num will also be rendered on our page 


if we do : 
 <h2>{num}</h2>   ---> we can also render the num variable in h2 tag 
 



  <h2>{num+200}</h2>    ---> will give output as 300 


    <h2>{console.log("vise")}</h2>          ---> will log the output in the console 


you can inject any js  code  inside {}

as soon as HeadingComponent is rendered , the code is executed 



* How to put react element in react component ?


const Title =(
  <h1 className="head">
    Title React Element
  </h1>
)



const num=100;
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    {Title}
    <h1 className="heading">Namste React HeadingFunctional Component </h1>
    
    <h2>{console.log("vise")}</h2>
    

  </div>
 
    
)

* How to put react element in react component ?

Here also , we simply need to pass our react element(title) inside {}
since element at the end of the day is a variable only (using const )



* How to put react element inside react element ?

same -> use {}

* You can also put functional component inside react element 
inside the element , it needs to be written as <ComponentName/>  ---> You can play around with these 


We can also call a function inside a component {function_Name() }


# Cross Site Scripting

const data =api.getData(); --> suppose a maliciaous data is coming from  api  , it can infect our system ( can get access to our cookies )

This type of attack is known as cross site scripting 



const num=100;
const data =api.getData(); // api is a function that returns data
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    {Title}
    <h1 className="heading">Namste React HeadingFunctional Component </h1>
    
    <h2>{num}</h2>
    {data}    -----------> malicious data 

  </div>
 
    
)

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<HeadingComponent />);


JSX will not blindly accept {data}
JSX will sanitize {data} , 
it prevents cross-site-scripting
