# ‚úÖ Why React Is Still Worth Learning in 2025
1. Dominates the Job Market
React continues to be one of the most in-demand front-end frameworks in job listings.

Companies from startups to enterprise (including those using Next.js) still actively hire React developers.

üíº If you‚Äôre aiming for employability, React is still one of the safest bets.

2. Mature Ecosystem & Community
Vast ecosystem of tools, libraries, and integrations.

Well-documented, with thousands of tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and GitHub projects.

Massive developer community = fast support and constant innovation.

3. Modern Features Keep It Competitive
React isn‚Äôt standing still. It now supports:

React Server Components

Concurrent Rendering

Suspense for Data Fetching

Improved developer tooling

Paired with frameworks like Next.js and Remix, it remains cutting-edge.

4. Flexibility & Scalability
React can be used for:

SPAs (Single Page Applications)

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) with Next.js

Mobile apps with React Native

Component libraries and design systems

5. Great for Career Transitions
If you already know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, React is a natural next step.

It opens doors to front-end, full-stack, and even mobile app development (via React Native).
  ===============================================================================================================================================
Lets get started : 

  # creating a basic hello world program in html 
  file--> index.html
  <h1>Hello World <h1> --> works fine 

# hello world using js


<body>
  <div id="root"> </div>
  <script>

    const heading=document.createElement("h1")
    heading.innerHTML="hello namaste react js";
    const root=document.getElementById("root");
    root.appendChild(heading);
    
  </script>
</body>
</html>
 ---> works fine 

# hello world using react


 lets get react to our project 

 1) using CDN --> cdn links react

 what is CDN ? 
 -->CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.

It‚Äôs a network of servers distributed around the world that helps deliver content (like images, videos, CSS, JS files, etc.) faster to users, no matter where they are.


in index.html 

 <body>
  <div id="root"> </div>

  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  
</body>
</html>


This means you're not downloading React locally ‚Äî you‚Äôre getting it from a CDN server (like unpkg or jsDelivr), which is:
Already optimized

Cached in many places around the world

Often already cached in the user‚Äôs browser from visiting other sites

whats inside these links ?   
1) react.development.js (core file of react )
--> react code (plain js )

2) react-dom.development.js (react DOM )


we just got these code into our project , we got the superpowerss of react into our code 

 Real-Life Examples of CDN Providers:
Cloudflare
Akamai
AWS CloudFront
Google CDN
jsDelivr / unpkg (popular for JavaScript/CDN links)


explore on browser --> console--> React--> scroll
explore on browser --> console--> ReactDOM--> scroll



# hello world using react

index.html
<body>
  <div id="root"> </div>

  <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<script>
  const heading=React.createElement("h1",{},"Namaste js form vs")
  const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
  root.render(heading);

</script>
  
</body>

---> works fine


# create a new js file and put react code there (APP.js)

<script src="App.js"> </script>

<script>
  const heading=React.createElement("h1",      ----> name of the tag (h1/p/spam...)
  {id:"heading"},                -----> attributes
  "Namaste js form vs")           ------> children 
  const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
  root.render(heading);          -----> converts the object to h1 tag
   

</script>

in index.css
#heading{
  color: rgb(96, 54, 222);
}


console.log(heading);   --> will return us object 
Hence React.createElement is an object at the end of the day ---> when rendered , it converts itself to HTML --> which browser understands



# breaking the above code line by line 

  1) const heading= React.createElement("h1",{id:"heading" , xyz:"vise"},"Namaste js form vs 1")

React.createElement(...)

This creates a React element of type h1.

It has two attributes: id="heading" and a custom attribute xyz="vise"(2nd one is just for demo purpose).

Its children (text content) is "Namaste js form vs 1".

if we do console.log(heading)  --> it will return us an object --> Hence React.createElement is an object at the end of the day


in line 2 ,3  you are trying to tell ‚ÄúHey React, I want to show something (a heading) inside this part of my HTML page (the div with id="root").‚Äù

  2) const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

ReactDOM.createRoot(...)


document.getElementById("root") ‚Üí This finds the HTML element like:

<div id="root"></div>

ReactDOM.createRoot(...) ‚Üí This initializes React's control over that div.
It prepares React to start rendering stuff inside it.

const root = ... ‚Üí You save this initialized React root in a variable so you can use it.




3)   root.render(heading);
You now say:

‚ÄúHey React, please render (display) the heading element inside the root (i.e., inside the <div id="root">).‚Äù

heading is the React element you created using:
React.createElement("h1", {...}, "Namaste js form vs 1")



# but what if our HTML structure is nested (multiple divs with multiple IDs)  

but it will make our react code very very complex . You may have to use arrays for such a simple task 

Even the HTML nested elements will look simpler infront of it . Then whats the use of React , insted of making our life simpler , its making our life complex.

# Solution --> JSX 

# E1 --> part 5


does the order of file matters ?
--> yes , it does 

if our html already consists a <h1> tag and we try to render the react app also , then what will happen ?

--> the html <h1> tag will be replaced by react (root.render)

JS is synchronus and when it will reach the  react (root.render) , it will just replace it 

 If we want to keep the existing contents of h1, we can use ReactDOM.render to render the new elements inside h1 without replacing its contents.
  

# React is a framework or  a library ? 

You can use react in a small section of your page ( a microservicde )  --> it can work as a library .Hence React is a library and not a full fleged framework . 








  # Difference between library and framework:
  // A library is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks, while a framework is a more comprehensive structure that provides a foundation for building applications. A library is typically used to add functionality to an existing application, while a framework provides a complete architecture for building an application from scratch.
  
  // react is a library for building user interfaces, while react-router is a framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) using react. React provides the core functionality for building UI components, while react-router provides the routing and navigation capabilities needed to create SPAs.
  
  // React can work independently in a small portion of our application , hence it is a library. 
  // But react-router is used to create a single page application, hence it is a framework.


// some examples of libraries are:
// 1. jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation. It is widely used for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.

// 2. Lodash: A modern JavaScript utility library that provides helpful functions for working with arrays, objects, and other data types. It is often used for data manipulation and functional programming tasks.
// ----------------------------------------------------

// Somw examples of frameworks are:
// 1. Angular: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building complex web applications.
// 2. Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable and can be used for building both small and large applications.
// 3. Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It provides a robust set of tools for building web applications, including an ORM, authentication, and an admin interface.
// 4. Ruby on Rails: A web application framework written in Ruby that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It emphasizes convention over configuration and provides a set of tools for building database-backed web applications quickly.
// 5. Flask: A lightweight Python web framework that is easy to use and flexible. It is often used for building small to medium-sized web applications and APIs.
// 6. ASP.NET: A web framework developed by Microsoft for building dynamic web applications and services using .NET technologies. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building enterprise-level applications.
// 7. Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is often used for building RESTful APIs and server-side applications.
// 8. Spring: A powerful Java framework for building enterprise-level applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building web applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices.
