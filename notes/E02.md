# Igniting our App (Part 1)

npm != node package manager 

but yes its a big package manager 

google --> npmjs.com --> see npm (top left )(jsut for fun )

terminal --> npm init


package.json file will be created --> configuration for npm
our project is dependent on many packages (dependencies).  
package.json keeps track of all the packages we are using
now we can get packages into our project 

---------------
bundler --> our whole code should be bundled together before sending to production. 

1st of all we will import bundler (webpack , parcel, vite)  

# parcel

we will be using parcel  (parcel is  a beast )

There are 2 types of dependencies which our app/project can have

1) dev dependency  --> requierd during developement phase 
2) normal dependency --> used in prodcuction also

npm install -D parcel      --> Here -D means dev dependency 

verify in pkg.json --> it will be shown as dev-dependency 

"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.14.4"
  }

	Version	     ^2.14.4  (major.patch.minor)
  

in the above line ^ means if tomorrow a newer (minor or patch  ) version is released (say "parcel": "^2.14.9" ) then it will be installed automatically due to ^ symbol.

However if there is a major upgrade (say "parcel": "^3.5.4") then it will not be installed 

Whereas if you use ~ say ("parcel": "~2.14.4") it will allow only patch updates 


Symbol |   	Version	  |       Allows updates up to
^	         ^2.14.4	          <3.0.0(minor and patch)
~	         ~2.14.4	           <2.15.0 (patch only)
  


we will also get a new file package-lock.json and a big folder node modules 

# what is package.lock.json 
it keeps track of exact version of the package/dependency  which is installed and our project is using .


# what is node modules
it contains all the code of the dependency which our project needs 




But we insatlled only parcel , then why are so many other modules also there in node modules ?

--> Its because ,we installed parcel but parcel also has many dependencies  , and other dependency might also  have their own dependency . This is known as transitive dependencies .

Every module inside node modules will also have its own package.json contains info about dependencies /packages   (This shows tranisitve depenedncy )


its so big that there are so many jokes around this (reddit node module jokes )


Its never a good idea to push node modules to production . Uncecessarily it will increase the burden of our file 
We dont want to push it to github 
Hence we will be using gitignore and we will place node_modules inside it


However , never put package.json and package.lock.json inside .gitignore , the reason is it contains info about all our dependencies .

And if you have package.json and package.lock.json you can regenerate all your node_modules , you just have to do npm install in that repository .
you can verify by delting node module and doing npm install again .

==> (whatever you can regenerate , you should not put it on git . It should only keep essential items )

# Igniting our APP (Part 2)

We will use parcel to ignite our app

npx parcel index.html
Built Success 
Server running at http://localhost:1234

If at all error occurs remove "main": "App.js" file from package.json (because we are specifying entrypoint as index.html )

npx parcel index.html -->  npx is similar to npm , when we do npm it means installaing a package but when we do  npx, it  means executing the package  
                           (and index.html is the main file) 

npx package_name source_file_name



The earlier used way in E01  (cdn links ) is not a good way to bring react to our projects because its a costly operation as it will make a network call and if version changes we will have to update those links everytime .

Its a better idea to have react also as a dependency in our package.json , so we dont have to update manually . Our node_modules already contains react we just need to install it .  


Now we will install react as a package 

 npm install react    --> we are installing react as a normal dependency , not as a dev dependency 

 verify in package.json and inside node modules 
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.1.0"
  }

  Now we will install react DOM  as a package 

npm i react-dom

 verify in package.json and inside node modules 

  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.1.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.1.0"
  }


  remove cdn links 
  now in App.js
  import React from "react";    --> it will import react from node_modules




# Parcel features (why Parcel is a beast ?)
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR =Hot Module Replacement  (just by saving the file it gets reflected on browser)
- Parcel uses a file watching algorithm  which is written in C++ , it keeps a track of all the changes .
- Faster builds and better dev experience due to caching (parcel-cache folder )
- Parcel also does image optimization
- If you make a production build it will minify/optimize the file also.
- Parcel will compress the file also , good for production.
- Consistent Hashing 
- Code Splitting 
- Differential Bundeling -> to support older browsers 
- Error Diagnostics and Error Handeling
- supports HTTPS also
- Tree Shaking --removes unused code 
- Different Dev Build  and Production Bundle 




Go through Parcel Doccumentation(parceljs.org) , its very amazing . (System Design concepts are kept here )
These things will help you in your system design interview . 

Hence React is not the only thing that is making our App fast in BTS bundlers like Parcel is also doing heavy lifting  for us 

PM Modi = React 
Amit Shah = Parcel 

** If the changes you are doing in your app is not being reflected , then try to delete parcel-cache and dist file and try runnig npx parcel .\index.html again



npx parcel build index.html   --> command for production build --> verify the files (index.html, App.js ) in dist folder --> its highly optimized vresion of our code .(This is optional and is used in production phase)


parcel-cache and dist file should be put to .gitignore because it can automatically be built( regenarated ) using the command  npx parcel .\index.html 



In pkg.json we can include browsersList (already present in our node_modules):  (browserlist.dev)  --> check the website,github:
 ex: it even lists that our app should run on 95% of US population's browser 

browserlist ensures that our app definately runs on these browsers

 "browserslist":[
 "last 5 chrome versions",
 "last 5 firefox versions",
 "last 5 safari versions",
 "last 5 edge versions"
  ]


  or 

  "browserslist":[
    "last 2 versions"           --> this means our App should work on last 2 versions of all the browswers (80% of world population)
  ]


using parcel we have created our own create-react-App
