# E06  --> Exploring the World


# Monolith and Microservice Architecture:


Monolith Architecture --> Traditinally Apps were developed using Monolith Architecture --> Everything in the same repo 
One big project --> contains API,UI,Auth code , DB code , Notification Code , 


Changing even a single code or making small changes  was a headache . Suppose you have to change the colour of the button --. Build and deploy the whole project



Now the whole world is moving towards microservie architecture 

In the microservice Architecture , we have different service fro differnet job --> UI service , notification service , Auth Service , API Service , DB Service 

Also called  Seperation of concerns --> each servie is responsible for each job 

All the Service combined together forms a big App --> 

How do these Services interact with each other ? 
UI service  will talk to backend to fetch data --> backend service needs to talk to API / Auth / DB 


In namste react Upto E05 we are making UI microservice . The UI microsevice is written in React 

Differnt microservice can also be written in different languages ---> 
All the big companies use multiple languages for different microservice  --> depends on the requirement , which tech stack suits them best .


Like our ui microservice ran on localhost:1234  --> All the other microservices run on differnt ports 

localhost:1234 --> UI Service                  ----> / 
localhost:1000  ---> Backend Service          ----> /api
localhost:3000 --->  SMS Service            --> /SMS


At the end of the day all the ports are mapped to domain name 

We will now see how the react Application will talk to differnet microservices outside the world ( Ex: backend / DB..)

# E06 Part-2
=============


Currently we are using mock data of resturants by copying them locally to our code ; But thats not a good practice , we will now see how we can fetch data of resturants dynamically 


Lets see how we can make API calls to fetch data from backend 

There are 2 approaches:-

1) As soon as our app loads --> we can make an API call ---> wait for data to come -->  Then render the UI

Suppose data  takes 500ms to come  --> our UI will render after 500 ms 


2) As soon as the page loads --->  we will just render the UI quickly(just the skeleton ) ----> make API call  --> re render our page with new Data


In react we will always be using the 2nd approach .

The 2nd way gives you the better UX (better user experience --> user doesnt see any jitteriness)   --> re rendering mechanism is too good in React --> Hence its something we dont need to bother about . 


# E06 Part-3
=============


Lets code the 2nd approach 
 We will have to make lot of API calls , Dont get distracted--> FOCUS 


 # use effect hook 

hook --> a normal js utility function wwhich is given to us by react(prebuilt function)(written by facebook developers) --> it has some superpowers

import { useEffect } from "react";

2 arguements are passed to useEffect 
  1--> Arrow function  --> callabck function---> it will be called after your component renders 
  2 --> Dependency Array 

 useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("useEffect called");    ---. callback function    

  },[])       ----> dependency Array 


1---> Callback function will be called after your component renders 

Currently we have written useEffect() in our body component --> when the body component rendre cycle is finished --> it will call this callback fucntion

This means if you want to do something after the component is rendered , you have to write it inside useEffect


  Currently if we run the code (npm start)   --> we will get "useEffect called" on the console 
  This is because after the body componet renders -->  use efect activates --> it will call this callback fucntion>



Use effect will help us to code using 2nd Approach 

once the component is rendered --> after rendering we will fetch the data inside useEffect()

Curremtly we are using mock data , but we want the data should come directly from the swiggy's API

  useEffect(()=>{
    fetchData();

  },[])

  const fetchData=()=>{
    const data =fetch(https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=25.770278&lng=87.487325&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING)
 
 const json= await data.json();
  console.log(json);
  }


** fetch is a superpower given to us by browser  / JS engine 


fetch will fetch data  from API (in this case Swiggy's API)
We cannot call Swiggy's API directly in our app -->Error--> Access is blocked by CORS policy 



CORS Policy 

Our browsers block us to call APIs from one origin to another orgin (youtube cors explained by akshay saini) -->(We are trying to call from local machine to swiggy's API)


There is a way we can bypass this CORS --> cors chrome extension  -->  will bypass the CORS error 

Now, 

JSON data is directly coming from SWiggy's API 

We have made live API call .


Now we want the new data to populate our page  

Currently we are rendering mock data 


Remember,
As soon as the page loads --->  we will just render the UI quickly(just the skeleton ) ----> make API call  --> re render our page with new Data

We have done till step 3 ( make API call )  --> now we want to re render our page with new data 


as soon as we have got the data , we will put the data into  ListOFResturants i.e --> (const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState(resList);)

as soon as listOfRestaurants updates , react will  re render the component and update the ui with new data 


The API will have a lot of data and we want to use just a specefic data(list of resturants) 




  const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState(resList);

  useEffect(()=>{
    fetchData();

  },[])

  const fetchData=async ()=>{
    const data =await fetch('https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=25.770278&lng=87.487325&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING');
  
  const json= await data.json();


  console.log(json); 

  console.log(json?.data?.cards[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants);

  setListOfResturant(json?.data?.cards[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)

  }



In the above code see carefully ; 
in set list of resturnats we are passing the API to get resturants data 
  setListOfResturant(json?.data?.cards[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)    -----------------> This format is called Optional Chaining (Good way of handling this type of data ) --> read about ut

Now when we render the page , 1st of all old data comes ,but after  few mili seconds page automatically refreshes with the new data (live data )  


As soon as the page loads --->  we will just render the UI quickly(just the skeleton ) ----> make API call  --> re render our page with new Data

we were getting old data at first beacyuse of 
  const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState(resList);




Now we no longer need the mock data since our new Data is coming drectly from the API .
We can delete the reslist and the mock data file also which we created earlier

  const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState([]);

  Now we will get the live data from the APi itself 




# E06 part 4
=============

Now when we load the page , we gwt a blank screen , for a few miliseconds and then we gwt the live data

Its a bad UX , we can improve this   
1) before the page loads , we can show a spinning loader 

if(listofresturant) is empty ----> render a loading screen 

  if(listOfRestaurants.length === 0) {
    return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
  }


Now when we render , 1st loading will appear on the screen and then finally the screen with data will load


However , this is not a good way to render ---> Instead of doing it like this we can use the concept of Shimmer UI

# ShimmerUI

google--> shimmer ui 

Shimmer is a temporary animation placeholder for when data from the service call takes time to get back and we don't want to block rendering the rest of the UI.
---> In simpler terms , shimmer UI lets us load a fake page meanwhile the actual page with real data still loads

iNSTEAD OF SHOWING LOADING WE CAN SHOW FAKE PAGE WITH FAKE CARDS

SWIGGY DOES THE SAME --> CHECK SWIGGY.COM --> BEFORE THE ACTUAL DATA COMES A FAKE SCREEN LOADS


All the new web apps are following shimmerUI  --> Even youtube follows shimmerUI




As soon as the page loads --->  we will just render the UI quickly(just the skeleton ) ----> make API call  --> re render our page with new Data


This is the approach we have been following ; So now, 

As soon as the page loads (load shimmer UI ) --->  we will just render the UI quickly(just the skeleton ) ----> make API call  --> re render our page with new Data


How to build our own ShimmerUI ?

we will make a seperate component component --> Shimmer.js --> amd add some basic styling to it .

and place the component like this 

 if(listOfRestaurants.length === 0) {
    return <Shimmer/>
  }

Now whenever we render our page 1st of all ShimmerUI will load 

This is a standard practice used across the industry whenever making UI apps 

Also called shimmer effect

The overall concept is known as conditional rendering

# E06 part 5
=============


we could have also used ternary operator to render those conditions

return listOfRestaurants.length === 0 ? <Shimmer/> :(


........ same code

)


In state hooks concept 

Lot of react developer gets confused , that why are we using State variable ? Why not simply use local variable ?


In header sectio we will build a login button on clicking on which it changes to logout button

 let btnName="Login"
 <button className="nav-item-login" onClick={()=>{btnName="Logout"; console.log("logout")}}>{btnName}</button> 

 Inside the header component we tried to render the logout button ; but it did not render . console.log(logout) got printed on console , this means callback function is being called , but However  UI didnt render 


 This is the perfect example why js normal variables are not used to carry out these types of changes .
 To change anything in the component , we need to use useState State variables 


   const [loginBtn, setLoginBtn] = useState("Login");

     <button className="nav-item-login" onClick={()=>{
            setLoginBtn("Logout");
             console.log(loginBtn)}}
             >{loginBtn}</button>


  now its working perfevtly --> header coponent got re-rendered   ---> This is the superpower of react 

  Is react refreshing the whole header or it refreshes just the button ?
  --> It will re -render the whole header component 

One more question arises to deves mind , how are we modifying  const variable ? isnt it against the JS principles ? -->  const [loginBtn, setLoginBtn] = useState("Login");

When we click the button --> It is basically calling/rendering the header function/component once again and this time the value of the variable is changed /updated with the new value  --> react keeps track of everything 

There is no change in any other part of the code , even there is not even a slight change in other componnets of header  --> This is diff algo --> This is reconcialiation process 



Now lets make it  like a taggle functionality ; if we clcik on logout ; it should again change to login and vice versa



<button className="nav-item-login" onClick={()=>{
            loginBtn==="Login" ? setLoginBtn("Logout"): setLoginBtn("Login");     ---> we just used ternary operator 
             console.log(loginBtn)}}
             >{loginBtn}</button>


now everytime we are clicking on the buttoin the header component renders again and again ---> This is the superpower that react provides us 



# E06 part 06 Building Search functionality
===========================================
 This portion will cover all the topics --> hooks/useState/useEffect/reconciliation/  --> How and when they should be used 



on clicking search button  we want to filter the resturants cards and update the UI

whatever user has searched ---> we have to take the value of that from  input box and bind that data into a local state variable with 
Now whenever we search something , we have to update the search Text so that it updates 


  const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");



      <div className="search">
      <input type="text"className="search-box" value={searchText} onChange={(e)=>{                   ---------------> the value searchtext is tied to input field 
        searchText(e.target.value);                                     ---------------------------> whenever something is typed to searchtext we have to update the searchtext 
      }}/>
      <button onClick={()=>{
        //we want to filter the resturants cards and update the UI
        console.log(searchText);

      }}>Search</button>



        </div>



Whenver we are typing something in the search box --> local State variables are being changed --> and we know that whenever local state variabes are cahnging---->  that menas that whole component is being re - rendered again 

on every key press ---our whole bodycomponent is getting re-rendered ---> YES , this is whats is happening -- This is a React Superpower 

check it by putting a console.log in the body component in the above part 

 const [listOfRestaurants , setListOfResturant]=useState([]);
  const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");

  console.log("Body Rendered");   ----> on every key press --> body is being rendered --->  "Body Rendered" is being printed on console again and again 
 in search box type --> cafe --> "Body Rendered" will be printed 4 times 

State Variable --> whenever state variable updates --> react re renders the component --> reconsiliation mechanism 

This is an awesome superpower of React which makes react so popwerful 


React is finding the difference between old Virtual DOM and new Virtual DOM 
DOM manipulation is very expensive operation and react is handling it very efficiently 



interview Qs --> why is react so fast ? -->
--> React is finding the difference between old Virtual DOM and new Virtual DOM ---> React Fiber 
DOM manipulation is very expensive operation and react is handling it very efficiently --> React will update the only portion of DOM that is required to be updated 





Now lets update the cards also in the UI 


After I got the search Text we want to filter out the listOfResturants  



   <button onClick={()=>{
        //we want to filter the resturants cards and update the UI
        console.log(searchText);

      const filteredResturant = listOfRestaurants.filter((res) => res.info.name.includes(searchText));

      setListOfResturant(filteredResturant);
      console.log(filteredResturant);



      }}>Search</button>



        </div>



on clicking on search button --> we will get resturant which includes search text  --> State variable is updated ---> ( setListOfResturant(filteredResturant);) --> component will be re -rendered


However , if the search text does not exactly matches the resturnat name (case sensitivity too )  ---> we will get an error 

we can convert both of them to lowercase or  uppercase (search text and resturan name )


 lets convert both of them to lowercase 
 const filteredResturant = listOfRestaurants.filter((res) => (res.info.name.toLowerCase()).includes(searchText.toLowerCase()));


One more bug is present here -->After we search soething -->  supppose we again search something -->  nothing will be  rendered   --> code broke
or suppose we search something which is not present ---> nothing will be rendered  --> code broke



Whenever we searched something --> we updated our listOfResturant (state var)  --. when we are searching once again we are actually searching in the updated ListOfresturant 
--> This is not a good functionality 


# E06 part 07
================

we are currently modifying the original lsit of resturant , instead we shoul keep a copy of filtered list and modify that only


we will create another state variable
 const [filteredResturant, setFilteredResturant] = useState([]);


 and instead of updating listOfResturant we will update filteredResturant using setFilteredResturant



and when we are rendering willl we use filteredResturant.map(.....)

  return listOfRestaurants.length === 0 ? <Shimmer/> :(
    <div className="body">
      <div className="filter">
        <div className="search">
      <input type="text"className="search-box" value={searchText} onChange={(e)=>{
        setSearchText(e.target.value);
      }}/>
      <button onClick={()=>{
        //we want to filter the resturants cards and update the UI
        console.log(searchText);

      const filteredResturant = listOfRestaurants.filter((res) => (res.info.name.toLowerCase()).includes(searchText.toLowerCase()));

      setFilteredResturant(filteredResturant);
      console.log(filteredResturant);



      }}>Search</button>



        </div>


In short , we have the copy of all the resturant in listOfresturant 
we are never modifying original listOfresturant



we will aslo have to modify the filteredResturant data for the 1st time when data comes(similar to setListofResturant) , or else nothing will be rendered for 1st time

setListOfResturant(json?.data?.cards[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)
  setFilteredResturant(json?.data?.cards[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants);




revise the code --> code slow and think more --> try to understant the functionality and the flow
