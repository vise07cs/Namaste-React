# E07 (Finding the Path )  Part -1 


lets learn about routing 


First lets dive deep to hooks 

1) use Effect hook

In header section

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("USe effect called ");   ----> callback function --> called everytime when our component re-renders (this behaviour will depend on dependency array  )
  }, []);   ---> dependency array 
---------------------------------------
When is useEffect called ?


Use effect is called everytime our component renders (in this case header component)  --> ("USe effect called  ")

dependency array changes the behaviour of the render 


* if you dont put dependency array , it will  render everytime ----> "use effect called" will be printed everytime you click on login /logout


  console.log("Header Component Rendered");

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Use effect called ");
  });



* if dependency array is empty -----> use Efffect is called on only initial render (just 1 time )
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("USe effect called ");   ----> callback function 
  }, []);   ---> dependency array 



* if we put something inside dependency array --> It will only be called when that dependency is changed or updated 



  const [loginBtn, setLoginBtn] = useState("Login");

  console.log("Header Component Rendered");

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Use effect called ");
  }, [loginBtn]);   ------>    Since everytime we are clicking loginBtn its getting updated , hence callback function will be called and  "Use effect called " will be printed



Hence in summary , callback function ("Use effect called ") will be callled 

1)  once initially when our component renders for the 1st time (initial render)


2) if dependency array is not present ---> callback function ("Use effect called ") will be called everytime the component re-renders


3) if dependency array is present and empty ---> callback function ("Use effect called ") will be called only once (due to initial render) --> will not be called everytime we click on login/logout

4) if dependency array is present and contains a state varailble /dependency ---> callback function ("Use effect called ") will be called everytime when state variable/dependency updates(in the above example loginBtn)




# E07 --Part-2

useState --> used to create local state variables inside your state component

best practices ----> never create state variables outside the component -> it will throw an error 
               ----> try to create them in the top always (js is synchronus )
               ----> never create useState inside if else block --> can create inconsistency  
               ----> never create useState inside loops and functions 

useState must be created inside functional component on the top --> thats how react will understand the code the best way 



# E07 --Part-3
==============

creating routes 
we will be using react route dom (google)


npm i react-router-dom

How to use this library ?

Lets create a about us page --> localhost:1234/about   

App.js  ---> This is our root level component -->  we have to create routing configurations here

import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

appRouter will contain an Array of list (list of objects) --> each object will define what will happen if we go on a certain path 

const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout/>
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />                                    ----> we created a About componenet
  }
])

we need to provide this confguration to render this ---> we will have to import Router Provider Component (React gives us this ) ---> Router Provider will provide our routing configurations to our App

import { createBrowserRouter , RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";


Earlier we rendered AppLayout directly

root.render(<AppLayout />);


Now instead of this we will use 

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);


# an unexpected error occured today 
 suddenly the api stopped working and started throwign error --> length is invalid in body --> i was surprised --> till morning it was working fine --> I banged my head --> used chatpt--> which suggested me to change the react version itself --> i did that too--> still website was not rendering 

 It suddenly striked to me what if the issue is with swiggy's API --> Akshay Sir told they keep on changing that --> Thats what haad happened 
 They had moved the resturants from cards[4]  to cards[2]   --> Hence I changed that in my code too and it started working just fine --> I am happy that I am able to resolve this issue on my own 
 --> Cheers ----->now lets move ahead 

====================
There are many browser Routers(depends on usecsaes ) but react recommends to use createBrowserRouter  --> and its the one which is mostly used


lets create a contact us page 


we will agiain have to create a Contact.js component ---> Instead of creating the whole component VS code provides us a shortcut --> just write rafce
However , you should write the component yourself --> atleast initially  --> After 6-7 months you can use shortcuts



const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout/>
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />
  },
  {
    path: "/contact",
    element: <Contact />
  }

])


Everythin is working fine --> however if we write an incorrect address in url (http://localhost:1234/xyz)--> it will show 404 not found

Creating our own error page 

create a new component --> Error.js  --> oops.somethnig went wrong , cat pic

const appRouter=createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout/>,
    errorElement: <Error/>          ----------------------> will show error page if incorrect component is selected

  }
])

There is one more intrestin way to handle error

React hook 

import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";  (in Error.js)  --> gives more detailed info about the errror (network / 404 not fourn)

* whenever you see something starting from use , its a hook (This is common react convention)


import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";


const Error=()=>{
    const err = useRouteError();
    console.log(err)
    console.log(err.status);
    console.log(err.statusText);
    console.log("Error Component Rendered");
    return (
        <div className="error">
            <h1>Oops!</h1>
            <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>
            <p>Please try again later.</p>
            <p>Error: {err.status} - {err.statusText}</p>                 -----> we are able to show exact error message 
        </div>
    );
}

export default Error;



Currently when we are going to /about or /contact page we are loosing our header component ---> we want that our header component should also be rendered 

# E07 Part -4
================

when we are on default path (/)  --> we are rendering 2 components --> 

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Body />
    </div>
  );
};


But when  we are on the /about page ---> only about componet is rendered , we want -----> 
 <Header />
 <About />

 both must be rendered

 similarly on other page also ---> both components must be rendered 


To get these types of functionality we have to create children routes

* ------------> Today swiggy has again changed resturants details from cards[2]   to cards [4]


To get these types of functionality we have to create children routes

 
children is again a  list of paths


we have to push the childrens according to the route to the main App component ---->  

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Body />  -----------------------> insted of <BOdy> component ---> rendering must be done of the component based on the condition (/--> Header+Body  , /About---> Header+About , /contact---> Header+contact  )
    </div>
  );
};

 ----> children ---> / , /about and /contact have become the children----> 
                                                                                                                                                      

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [           ----->currently therer are 3 children 
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],

    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);



const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Body />  -----------------------> insted of <BOdy> component ---> rendering must be done of the component based on the condition (/--> Header+Body  , /About---> Header+About , /contact---> Header+contact  )
                --------------------> In order to load componeent according to our conditions ---> react Router DOM comes to rescue  --> Import outlet 
    </div>
  );
};


import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider , Outlet} from "react-router-dom";


const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Body />  -----------------------> insted of <BOdy> component ---> rendering must be done of the component based on the condition (/--> Header+Body  , /About---> Header+About , /contact---> Header+contact  )
       <Outlet/>         --------------------> In order to load componeent according to our conditions ---> react Router DOM comes to rescue  --> Import outlet 
    </div>
  );
}


Now when we re renmdering /about  , /contact ---> our page is being rendered with header component intact 


Now we can also link the pages according to the header section --> if someone clicks on About , Contact ---> take them to respectice pages

we can simply use anchor tag in html .. It will work just fine  <a>  -->           <a href="/about">About Us</a>

But the biggest issue in anchor tag is that if we use it , whole page will get reload/ refreshed --> This will make app slow 

but using react we can move to a new page without refreshing whole page  ---> thats the superpower of react

Instead of this we can use Link   component ---> works same as anchor tag:

import {Link} from "react-router-dom"

<li className="nav-item"><Link to ="/"> Home </Link>  </li> 

 <li className="nav-item"><Link to ="/about"> About Us </Link>  </li>

  <li className="nav-item"><Link to ="/contact"> Contact us </Link>  </li>

Now whenever we are clicking on Home ,About and contact buttons in header section  ---> only the particular component is being rendered.  --> whole page is not being reloaded

This is the reason why our page is known as single page application ---> Every page is actually a component --> and on a single page


There are 2 types of routing which you can have in web apps :-

1) server-side-routing ----> In Earlier days ,  whenever we used to click on a link (ex /about) --> in the backend a network call was made and data was fetched from the server  --> This was server side routing 


2) client side routing ---> whereas in client side routing , no network call is made --> all the code is already present --> whenever we click on /about --> it just loads the whole component . We dont have to fetch anything from the server . 
 The above code just written is an example of client side routing.

 Whenever we are making any react app --> we should  use client side routing


# E07 Part-5
==========================

Till now we were just playing around with dummy pages --> Now we want to make actual features --> Whenever we click on a resturant --> It should take us on that resturant --> And load the data ---> just like swiggy

Now we will implement dynamic routing --> swiggy.com  -->  select a resturant  --> see how the url changes 

ex--> https://www.swiggy.com/restaurants   ---> after selecting a resturant --> https://www.swiggy.com/city/purnea/kathi-junction-vivekanand-colony-purnea-rest441024

if you check on the console --> network --> whenever we are clicking on the resturant --> an APi call is being made to fetch resturant data  --> since the data is too big and due to oversize its not showing in JSON viewer

Creating a resturant menu page 
=============================


we need to make something like ----> /resturant/resturantName

Creating a resturant menu page 
=============================

creating ResturantMenu component  ---> we will use the same component for every resturant --> with just different dynamic data loaded inside it for different resturants 


now we habe to add it as a path 
in  App.js --> child routes 

  {
        path: "/resturants/:resId",               --------> /:resId   ----> this part is dynamic --> can be changed according to id of resturant 
        element: <ResturantMenu  />,
      },


http://localhost:1234/resturants/123 ---> now whebever we type a url like this , our ResturantComponent is being rendered . Currently we are providing random resId 

--> resturnt details should change according to the resId


---> now we will dynamically get the resturants data from swiggy's API 



when the resturant component loads  ---> actual data must load --> make API call  
This means we need to make API call after the component renders ---> for this purpose we will be using useEffect Hook


  useEffect(() => {
    
    
}, []);       ---> we will use empty dependency array ---> we wnat only the component rendered once (on initial render)


function tofetch resturant menu data 

const fetchMenu = async () => {
  const data=await fetch("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/menu/pl?page-type=REGULAR_MENU&complete-menu=true&lat=25.770278&lng=87.487325&restaurantId=397777&catalog_qa=undefined&submitAction=ENTER");


const json=await data.json();
console.log(json);
}
