Resolving Swiggy API issue :


  //swiggy API url 
  swiggy.com (select any location)
inspect --> network --> refresh --> fetch/XHR --> v5lat?..

 https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/resturants/list...   --> copy this URL
RT --> copy --> copy link address
This is the API URL.

Install extension JSON viewer 

Now we wnat to get the data out of it 


Currently The API is returning the data for everything  (best offers , best cuisines , top resturants ,whats on ur mind  )
This is called config -driven -ui
Data is coming according to the specefied locations  

Suppose we want to get the data of only  the resturants in our locality

cards (an array of multiple objects )-->
  (1st card/ object)  --> offers 
  (2nd card /object)  --> whats on your mind 
  (3rd card /object)  --> Top restrant chains in your city
  (4th card /object)  --> restrant  in your city  (only Title)
  (5th card /object)   --> Filters 
  
  (6th card /object)   --> Details of Resturants (List of object) (nested) . Array of Resturants [{res1},{res2},{res3},{res4},{res5},{res6} ]
   
   Tomorrow the API structure might change and our list of resturant may go to 8th card . So it important to understand the flow of the data .We need to stay updated with the changes . This is an industry practice . Because data comes from live APIs 



Now to extract the resturat data :-
console.log(json.data.cards[5].card.card.gridElements.infoWithStyles.resturants)   (But activate the CORS Plugin )




const fetchData =async()=>{
  cosnt data =await fetch(

  //swiggy API url 
  

  )
}

const json =await data.json()

 //optional chaining

 seeListOfResturants(json?.data?.card[5]?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyles?.resturants)
